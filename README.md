# Developer Board Review

A Code Institute course project requirement. You can see the deployed site [here] https://dooco-pp4.herokuapp.com/

## Introduction
A hobby electronic and microprocessor development site where users can post articles and can add comments in order to build a community of developers sharing their creations. This blog style website can provide a platform for hobbyists to showcase their electronic and microprocessor projects and connect with other like-minded individuals. Users can post their projects along with detailed descriptions and images allowing other users to learn from and appreciate their work. Additionally, comments and likes can provide a means for users to share feedback, offer advice, and show their support for fellow hobbyists. This can lead to a vibrant community of makers, where users can learn from each other, collaborate on projects, and push the boundaries of hobby electronics and microprocessor development.

## WEBSITE DESIGN

## Testing


### Project set-up and deployment steps
### Create Repository



#### To create a new repository:

-  Log in to GitHub.
-  Click on 'repositories'.
-  Click on 'new' button, which create a new repository.
-  Select CodeInstitute template from the dropdown menu. 
-  Name project by adding title, 'PP4'.
-  Select 'Add Read.Me'.
-  Click 'create repository'.
-  Open repository and click green 'GitPod' button to create workspace.

#### Install Django 

- Install Django: pip3 install 'django' 
- Create project: django-admin startproject PP4 .
- Create app: python3 manage.py startapp joinus
- Add app to installed settings: INSTALLED_APPS = [ ... 'django.contrib.staticfiles', 'joinus',]
- Migrate: python3 manage.py migrate
- Run http server to confirm installation was successful: python3 mange.py runserver
#### Install libraries
- Install Cloudinary: pip3 install cloudinary

- Create requirements

Connect to Heroku and ElephantSQL
- Create Heroku App
- Create new instance on Elephant SQL and copy DB url
- Create env.py, adding the secret key. Ensure env.py is in gitignore
- Import env.py into Settings, and edit secret key accordingly
- Comment out original databases in Settings
- Connect to ElephantSQL
- Make migrations
- Test connect to ElephantSQL was successful
- Add config vars to Heroku

Connect to Cloudinary
- Add Cloudinary API environment variable to env.py
- Add Cloudinary API environment variable to Heroku Config Vars
- Add DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC to Heroku config vars
- In Settings,  "Installed Apps", add cloudinary_storage and cloudinary

Set up Directories and deploy
- In Settings, under STATIC_URL add STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.StaticHashedCloudinaryStorage', and add STATICFILES_DIRS, STATIC_ROOT, MEDIA_URL, DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE
- Add Templates Directory under BASE_DIR in settings, and fill in brackets for "DIR": []
- Add Heroku host name to ALLOWED_HOSTS
- Add top level directories
- Add a procfile
- In Heroku, link to GitHub as the deployment method

#### Final deployment

- In settings, 
    - Set DEBUG to False. If this is not done, cloudinary images won't be served and traceback error messages will be shown to the user (which can also reveal credentials that can benefit hackers).
- Update Heroku configuration settings. Remove CollectStatic.
