It packs cutting-edge features like USB-C power input, two video outputs that can each run an external 4K monitor, and a choice of RAM complements—a first for any Raspberry Pi. With all this extra potential in a board much the same size as earlier Pi models, comes a lot of heat that could lead to shutdowns, especially if you're using the Pi 4 to stream video or perform other such resource-intensive tasks.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: tablet-gothic, -apple-system, &quot;system-ui&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 18px;\">The Raspberry Pi 4 is a tiny single-board computer, which means that all of its components, from the memory to the USB ports, fit on one PCB without add-on cards or accessories. It measures 2.2 by 3.4 inches and stands about 0.6 inch tall. It's hardly the only inexpensive single-board computer out there, but thanks in part to the efforts of its creator (the nonprofit, education-focused Raspberry Pi Foundation), it's the best known.</p><p style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: tablet-gothic, -apple-system, &quot;system-ui&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 18px;\"></p><p style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: tablet-gothic, -apple-system, &quot;system-ui&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 18px;\">This diminutive circuit board features all the building blocks of a consumer PC, scaled down. In addition to 4GB of RAM, you get a Broadcom quad-core processor running at 1.5GHz, four USB Type-A ports, two micro HDMI video outputs, a gigabit Ethernet jack, and radios for 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 5.0.</p><p style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: tablet-gothic, -apple-system, &quot;system-ui&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 18px;\">Despite all of these familiar components, two major things are missing that set the Pi 4 apart from the legions of cheap tiny desktops you'll find on Newegg or Tiger Direct. Raspberry Pi boards don't have any type of hard drive, and they're not designed to run Microsoft's Windows 10 operating system. Instead, you have to install your own operating system (typically, the Linux-based Raspbian) onto a microSD card and slip that into a slot on the Pi 4's underside for it to work.</p><p style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: tablet-gothic, -apple-system, &quot;system-ui&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 18px;\">This rather unorthodox process means that the Raspberry Pi is best suited for tinkerers and makers, who might use it as the brains of a DIY weather station or even a TV embedded in a bathroom mirror. It's also attractive to scientists and the burgeoning artificial intelligence market, since it can be used in proof-of-concept prototypes like robots or image sensors. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory even used a Raspberry Pi to serve as the brains of a rover prototype last year, complete with seismic sensors.</p><p style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: tablet-gothic, -apple-system, &quot;system-ui&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 18px;\">Almost all of these applications make use of the Pi 4's 40-pin General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) connector, which can provide power for external sensors, as well as send data to and receive data from them. In the Pi 4, the versatile GPIO connector remains unchanged from previous versions.</p><p><br></p>", "featured_image": "image/upload/v1687346454/gajrw70wwual1tumomrt.jpg", "excerpt": "The Raspberry Pi 4 is a tiny single-board computer, which means that all of its components, from the memory to the USB ports, fit on one PCB without add-on cards or accessories", "created_on": "2023-06-21T11:20:52.988Z", "status": 1, "likes": []}}, {"model": "joinus.boardfeature", "pk": 2, "fields": {"board_name": "3.7V to 9V Boost Converter", "slug": "37v-to-9v-boost-converter", "author": 2, "category": 6, "update_on": "2023-06-23T05:52:02.708Z", "manufacturer": "Power Electronics", "special_features": "How to design a 3.7V to 9V Boost Converter Circuit using MC34063 DC−to−DC converter IC.

Like other power supplies, an SMPS transfers power from a DC or AC source (often mains power, see AC adapter) to DC loads, such as a personal computer, while converting voltage and current characteristics. Unlike a linear power supply, the pass transistor of a switching-mode supply continually switches between low-dissipation, full-on and full-off states, and spends very little time in the high dissipation transitions, which minimizes wasted energy. A hypothetical ideal switched-mode power supply dissipates no power. Voltage regulation is achieved by varying the ratio of on-to-off time (also known as duty cycles). In contrast, a linear power supply regulates the output voltage by continually dissipating power in the pass transistor. The switched-mode power supply's higher electrical efficiency is an important advantage. Switched-mode power supplies can also be substantially smaller and lighter than a linear supply because the transformer can be much smaller. This is because it operates at a high switching frequency which ranges from several hundred kHz to several MHz in contrast to the 50 or 60 Hz mains frequency. Despite the reduced transformer size, the power supply topology and the requirement for electromagnetic interference (EMI) suppression in commercial designs result in a usually much greater component count and corresponding circuit complexity. Switching regulators are used as replacements for linear regulators when higher efficiency, smaller size or lighter weight is required. They are, however, more complicated; switching currents can cause electrical noise problems if not carefully suppressed, and simple designs may have a poor power factor.", "featured_image": "image/upload/v1687588375/by5fusjxf2a1byz7rsd5.jpg", "excerpt": "A switched-mode power supply (switching-mode power supply, switch-mode power supply, switched power supply, SMPS, or switcher) is an electronic power supply that incorporates a switching regulator to convert electrical power efficiently.", "created_on": "2023-06-24T06:32:55.519Z", "status": 1, "likes": []}}, {"model": "joinus.boardfeature", "pk": 15, "fields": {"board_name": "Camera security circuit", "slug": "camera-security-circuit", "author": 6, "category": 3, "update_on": "2023-06-24T06:48:46.949Z", "manufacturer": "Home Electronics", "special_features": "The module was initially designed for surveillance purposes.

The sensor\r\nis used to monitor temperatures of heavy duty induction motors during operation. The sensor constantly\r\nmonitors motor temperature and displays on LCD Display. As soon as the temperature rises beyond certain\r\nlimit, the system turns off the motor to avoid fires or coil burning. Similarly we use a vibration sensor to\r\nmonitor the motor vibrations during operation.. The vibration of motor is displayed on LCD display as it runs. If\r\nthe motor vibrates beyond certain limit the system turns off the motor to avoid any damage to machine or\r\nmotor so that it can be fixed in time and avoid any accidents. Thus the system provides a complete induction\r\nmotor controlling as well as protection system for industrial applications. controll the induction motor through\r\nandroid app on our smartphone also we get live reading of speed, temperature, and vibration.", "featured_image": "image/upload/v1687589246/jkmt1esgpweusvrfage0.jpg", "excerpt": "Induction Motor Controller and Protection system serves this purpose of controlling the speed and direction of the induction motor along with protecting it from high vibration and temperature", "created_on": "2023-06-24T06:47:26.035Z", "status": 1, "likes": []}}, {"model": "joinus.review", "pk": 1, "fields": {"board": 2, "name": 2, "body": "Brilliant board to have in your repository.
